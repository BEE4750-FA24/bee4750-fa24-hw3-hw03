Then, use this to develop a strategy to ensure regulatory compliance for keeping the regulatory limit on DO concentration above 4 [mg/L]. On a broader environmental level, it is necessary to ensure the regulatory limit on DO concentration above 4 [mg/L] is upheld so that aquatic ecosystems with organisms and respective habitats can survive, and hypoxia does not occur.\n",

All three concentrations are given as input parameters, and are implemented in later model components.\n",

Account for the DO, CBOD, and NBOD concentration from  Waste Stream 1 at distance d, onwards through the length of the river. Also account for the DO, CBOD, and NBOD concentration from Waste Stream 2, starting at a distance of d + 15 [km] to analyze how the variations of CBOD and NBOD can affect DO depletion in the river flow model. \n",
        "    - Component 3: Implement the effects of oxygen reaeration on the system as it changes with distance, which involved atmospheric oxygen being reabsorbed into the river water. The rate at which oxygen reaeration occurs is proportional to the difference between the DO saturation concentration [mg/L] and the observed DO concentration [mg/L] at each simulation step-size (where step size = 1 [km]). \n",

        "- **Step-size choice:** Chose a step size of 1 [km] for d = 0:1:50 # [km]. A step size of 1 [km] was chosen to provide a highly comprehensive, thorough representation of the river flow model to show how the DO concentration varies with distance from 0 to 50 km in the river.\n",
        "- **Minimum DO concentration and plot discussion:** \n",
        "    - Based on the output of the model, as detailed in the Final Answer section, the minimum DO concentration is C_min = 3.0261584628034104, which signals that the regulatory limit of keeping DO concentration above 4 mg/L was not upheld during the simulation.\n",
        "    - The plot of Dissolved Oxygen Concentration Variations over River Distance, with an independent variable Distance d [km] and a dependant variable, DO Concentration [mg/L] presents an interesting representation of the river flow model. First, the river inflow experiences a slight decrease in DO concentration before experiencing reaeration. At a distance of 15 km, Waste Stream 1 source flows into the river, during which a sharp decrease in DO concentration occurs before reaeration overtakes oxygen depletion, allowing for an increase until 30 km. At 30 km, Waste Stream 2 source flows into the river, the point at which a sharp decrease in DO concentration occurs again due to oxygen depletion, before then once again increasing as reaeration overtakes the oxygen depletion. The increasing DO concentration continues over the remainder of the distance d of the river flow model, up to 50 km. The significance of steep increases and decreases provides insights into the adjustment period for the river when accounting for Waste Stream source inflow DO, NBOD, and CBOD concentrations. \n",
        "- **Rectification based on modeling results:** \n",
        "    - It would be wise to investigate the possibility of changing factors which influence DO in order to protect water quality and aquatic life, prevent hypoxia, and ensure the regulatory limit of >4 [mg/L] is upheld. For instance, some factors influencing DO include organic waste decomposition, nitrification, temperature, and pressure. For this waste treatment plan design, a treatment consisting of temperature decrease could be utilized in Waste Stream 1 and Waste Stream 2 in order to ensure that DO concentration stays above 4 [mg/L]. According to The United States Environmental Protection Agency (https://www.epa.gov/caddis/dissolved-oxygen), higher temperatures decrease oxygen solubility in water, which then lessens the amount of DO that can be held by the water. This reinforcing feedback means that when the opposite is done, (i.e. decreasing the river inflow, Waste Stream 1, and Waste Stream 2 water temperatures), the solubility is thereby increased, which increases the amount of DO that can be held by the water. An additional chemical treatment would still be necessary to prevent CBOD and NBOD decay in Waste Stream 1 and 2 inlets, as the DO concentration may not accumulate enough by the respective inlets to allow for the regulatory limit of >4 [mg/L] to be upheld. \n",
        "    - For the chemical treatment for this river flow model, it is most essential to treate Waste Stream 1 and Waste Stream 2 approximately equally since the minimum treatment required for Waste Stream 1, with no Waste Stream 2 treatment [%] = 95.88%, and the minimum treatment required for Waste Stream 2, with no Waste Stream 1 treatment [%] = 95.63%. The percentage values for both Waste Stream 1 and Waste Stream 2 are within .25% of one another, so they should be treated approximately equally. Additionally, since the minimum percentage of required treatment is high (close to 100%) for both Waste Stream 1 and Waste Stream 2, it is necessary to chemically treat both sources for a large reduction in Total Oxygen Demand required to align with the Maximum Oxygen Demand value of 6 mg/L. For instance, the Total Oxygen Demand for Waste Stream 1 is 85 mg/L, which requires a large reduction through chemical treatment. Similarly, the Total Oxygen Demand for Waste Stream 2 is 80 mg/L, which also requires a large reduction through chemical treatment.\n",
        "- To make a final conclusion, this simulation should be applied based on real-world, empirical data for a specified river that has 2 Waste Stream sources. The use of empirical data allows for a more thorough, comprehensive, and accurate analysis for specific sites. "
