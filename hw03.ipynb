        "##### Specific Reference to Modeling Results\n",
        "- **Step-size choice:** Chose a step size of 0.05 [km] for range_distance = 0:0.05:50. Rather than choosing a step size in integral form, such as 1 or 5, a step size of 0.05 was chosen to provide a highly comprehensive, thorough representation of the river flow model to show how the DO concentration varies with distance from 0 to 50 km in the river.\n",
        "- **Minimum DO concentration and plot discussion:** Based on the output of the model, as detailed in the Final Answer section, the minimum DO concentration = 0.0 [mg/L] and occurs at a distance D = 0.0 [km]. The reasoning for this is outlined in the discussion of the plot below:\n",
        "    - The plot of Dissolved Oxygen Concentration Variations over River Distance, with an independent variable Distance D [km] and a dependant variable, Dissolved Oxygen Concentration [mg/L] presents an interesting representation of the river flow model. First, the DO concentration [mg/L] from the ranges of D = (10,20) and D = (23,35) on the graph resulted in the constraint that DO concentration cannot be negative, and as such, are represented as a value of 0.0 [mg/L] in these ranges. Furthermore, a sharp increase and decrease occurs at D = 20 and D = 23, which signals a fast drop in DO concentration. This change is supported by Waste Stream 2 inflow beginning at D = 23 [km] (since Waste Stream 1 began at 8 [km], and 8 + 15 [km] = 23 [km]). The significance of this steep increase and decrease provides insights into the adjustment period for the river when accounting for Waste Stream 2's inflow DO, NBOD, and CBOD concentrations. Furthermore, the graph begins to increase in a convex manner at D = 35 [km]. Therefore, after adjusting rapidly to the Waste Stream 2 inflow, in which the DO concentration returns to 0, DO then begins and continues to accumulate with no additional inflows.\n",
        "- **Maximum DO Concentration discussion:** Furthermore, the printed output shows that the maximum DO concentration = 4.6565612446030045[mg/L] and occurs at a distance = 41.95[km]. This maximum represents an inflection point, and the regulatory limit is upheld at this point since 4.6565612446030045 [mg/L] is greater than 4.0 [mg/L]. \n",
        "- **Rectification based on modeling results:** it would be wise to investigate the possibility of changing factors which influence DO in order to protect aquatic life, prevent hypoxia, and ensure the regulatory limit of >4 [mg/L] is upheld. For instance, some factors influencing DO include temperature, pressure, salinity, and plant and microbial life. For this waste treatment plan design, a treatment consisting of temperature decrease could be utilized in Waste Stream 1 and Waste Stream 2 in order to ensure that DO concentration stays above 4 [mg/L]. It is most essential to treate Waste Stream 1 as DO concentrations drop to approximately 0 [mg/L] before reaching Waste Stream 2. Such a minimum is dangerous for the river flow model, and this is also shown by the drop to 0 [mg/L] at the Waste Stream 2 inlet. According to The United States Environmental Protection Agency (https://www.epa.gov/caddis/dissolved-oxygen), higher temperatures decrease oxygen solubility in water, which then lessens the amount of DO that can be held by the water. This reinforcing feedback means that when the opposite is done, (i.e. decreasing the river inflow, Waste Stream 1, and Waste Stream 2 water temperatures), the solubility is thereby increased, which increases the amount of DO that can be held by the water. An additional chemical treatment would still be necessary to prevent CBOD and NBOD decay in Waste Stream 1 and 2 inlets, as the DO concentration may not accumulate enough by the respective inlets to allow for the regulatory limit of >4 [mg/L] to be upheld.
